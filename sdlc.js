// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
//1.Planning
//2.Analysis of Requirements
//3.Design
//4.implementation
//5.Testing & Integration
//6.Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "this would be the process of which you would analize what needs to be done in a a given project, additional what are the requirments needed for said project"
const design = "designing is the over all structure of the code which includes back-end & front-end"
const implementation = "this would be the actual action of introducing you ideas to the code base"
const Testing = "this would be the testing and integration of making sure the code works"
const maintain = "would be making sure the code works over a period of time"
